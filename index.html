        <h1>Abandonded Shopping Cart</h1>

        <p><i>Abandonded Shopping Cart</i> Abandoned Shopping Cart is a data visualization project that explores the phenomenon of stray supermarket carts across different neighborhoods in Singapore, highlighting potential gaps in urban infrastructure planning. 
            <br><br> 
            The <i>storymap</i> utilizes community data to map locations where shopping carts are frequently abandoned, analyzing their distance from the nearest supermarkets, public transport nodes, and residential areas. By visualizing these ‘endpoints,’ the project seeks to uncover patterns in urban design that may contribute to this issue.
            <br><br>
            Through the <i>crowdsourced map</i>, users can report abandoned shopping carts via the Ushahidi platform, contributing to a broader discussion on urban convenience, accessibility, and infrastructure improvements.
